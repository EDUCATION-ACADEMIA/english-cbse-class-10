<title>How did Hari describe Anils face?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="His face was clear and unlined; even I had more marks on my face, though mine were mostly scars. Explanation: The thief then said that he had worked as a cook for Anil for almost a month. He had not cheated Anil apart from the one rupee that he used to take daily from the shopping.When Hari Singh saw Anil for the first time, he found him to be simple, easy-going, kind and easy to fool around. He thought he would be the right person to rob. He offered himself to work for him.Answer: Hari Singh realised that Anil knew about the theft because he found some of the notes still wet. He gave him a fifty-rupee-note and did not mention anything about the theft. This made him feel that Anil had forgiven him.Expert-Verified Answer He knew that anil would be merely sad when he discovered the theft. He would not be sad because of the theft of his hard-earned money, but the trust he showed would bother him. Hari had to return to him because he did not have any friends and staying at a hotel would make others suspicious.He changed his name every month for his own safety from the police and his former employers.">
