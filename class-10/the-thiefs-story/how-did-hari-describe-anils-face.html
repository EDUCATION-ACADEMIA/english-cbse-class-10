<meta name="description" content="His face was clear and unlined; even I had more marks on my face, though mine were mostly scars. Explanation: The thief then said that he had worked as a cook for Anil for almost a month.

He thought he would be the right person to rob. He offered himself to work for him.Answer: Hari Singh realised that Anil knew about the theft because he found some of the notes still wet. He gave him a fifty-rupee-note and did not mention anything about the theft. This made him feel that Anil had forgiven him.Expert-Verified Answer He knew that anil would be merely sad when he discovered the theft. He would not be sad because of the theft of his hard-earned money, but the trust he showed would bother him. Hari had to return to him because he did not have any friends and staying at a hotel would make others suspicious.He changed his name every month for his own safety from the police and his former employers.">
