Answer: Hari Singh did not have any friends and he did not want to make anyone curious about staying at one of the small hotels near the station.Ans. Anil employed Hari Singh to cook. But the food he prepared was so terrible that Anil had to give it to the stray dogs. And so, Anil asked Hari Singh to leave the very first day.Why did Hari Singh decide to come back to Anil? Ans. Hari Singh decided to come back to Anil because he felt that when Anil would come to know about the theft, he would feel sad, not for the loss of money but for the loss of trust. He did not want to lose his trust.Ans. Anil handed Hari Si h fifty-rupee note as payment for his services. He went on to that since he had started making money, he would pay Hari regularly. However, I knew about Hari and did not want him to be tempted again for want of money.In the beginning Hari was quite good at stealing and betraying others. As he never had anyone to show him the right way, he strayed from the right path and was dishonest fellow . But at the end because of Anils kind gesture he changed Hari completely .">
