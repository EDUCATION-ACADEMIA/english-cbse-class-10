<title>Why cant the boy buy a new ball?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Answer: The poet does not offer to buy the boy another ball because the new ball would not console him. The reason is that he had a great attachment to the lost ball. He is learning, well behind his desperate eyes.This line means that no one can buy something that is lost forever. No one can buy the boy that very ball which he has lost. Money is an external thing. It is a medium of possessing things. But even money cannot compensate for the sense of loss suffered by a person.The poet says I will not intrude on him because he wants the boy to learn the meaning of loss on his own. He does not offer him money to buy another ball because according to him, money or another ball is worthless.If his loss is irreparable or irretrievable, then how should one handle it? What lesson can be learnt? Solution : Yes, the boy should be allowed to grieve for his ball, as he had that ball for a long time. He had many old memories associated with it since his childhood.Answer. Explanation: We can buy a lot of things from money but we cannot buy our memories, experiences etc from money. The another ball worthless because the boy can play with the new ball but the experiences and attachment he had with the lost ball couldnt be brought back.">
