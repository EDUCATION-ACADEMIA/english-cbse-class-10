She wrote: As Ive told you many times, Im split in two. One side contains my exuberant cheerfulness, my flippancy, my joy in life and, above all, my ability to appreciate the lighter side of things.She described Kitty as a nice 14-year-old girl and said that they were becoming close friends. Out of all the characters from her club, Kitty was the one who slowly but surely emerged as Annes best friend.">
