The boy had a long association with the ball. It was, thus, useless to give him such a suggestion because he wanted to get back the ball that he had lost.He does not offer him money to buy another ball because according to him, money or another ball is worthless. The boy was trying to understand his first responsibility as he had lost something, which could not be brought back.Please find the answer.

It is difficult to console the boy as he had a long association with the lost ball and he wanted it back. Regards.Solution : The poet did not console the boy for two reasons.-one, the boy was too shocked and grief – stricken to listen to any sense, second, the poet also observed that the boy was trying to stand-up or bear the loss on his own through self-understanding which is much more reflective and lasting.Answer: Answer:The poet says I will not intrude on him because the boy, for the first time in his life, experiences the grief of losing a much loved possession-his ball. He does not want to disturb the boy as he wants him to feel what it is like to lose something.">
