<meta name="description" content="Answer: This line means that no one can buy something that is lost forever. No one can buy the boy that very ball which he has lost. Money is an external thing. It is a medium of possessing things.This poem is about losing something which we love and then learning to grow up. It is about a little boy, who in his young life, for the first time, is learning what it is like to experience grief after the loss of a much-beloved possession which is here his ball.According to the poet, the boy is learning about responsibility from the loss of the ball. By losing the ball, the boy has also lost all the childhood memories associated with that ball. Simply buying a new ball cannot bring back these memories.Offering him money to buy another ball would also be futile because the boy can never truly recover what he has lost. The poet wants the boy to learn about responsibility and to know how to keep moving forward even in the face of suffering and loss. Was this answer helpful?In the poem, money is external means that money can only buy all worldly or materialistic things. The poet wants to say that it cannot buy emotions, attachment, love, childhood etc. Once these things are lost, they are lost forever and they never come back.">
