<meta name="description" content="(b) Money or another ball is worthless for the boy because he has lost something dear to him. He is suffering from a sense of loss.Answer: The poet says I will not intrude on him because he wants the boy to learn the meaning of loss on his own. He does not offer him money to buy another ball because according to him, money or another ball is worthless.Offering him money to buy another ball would also be futile because the boy can never truly recover what he has lost. The poet wants the boy to learn about responsibility and to know how to keep moving forward even in the face of suffering and loss. Was this answer helpful?It has a deeper meaning. The loss of the ball is the loss of childhood and the loss of his dreams. And if it is lost, it never comes back again. Similarly, we cant console the child that he can have another ball. Actually, he is sad that the ball he has lost cant be brought back.Answer: The poet says so because no one can buy the ball back because it is lost. He means to say that money cannot compensate for the sense of loss.">
