<meta name="description" content="Accordingly, she could not find any house where nobody has died. She realized that being selfish in her grief, she reminded all of them about their deepest grief. Apparently, she accepted the truth that death is common to all.The Buddha asked her to find a house where no one had lost a loved one, but Kisa was unable to find any such house. She then saw the flickering lights of city and realised that peoples lives are similar to these lights which rise and then extinguish. In this way, she realised that life and death is a normal process.Kisa Gotami went from house to house, trying to find the mustard seed. At the first house, a young woman offered to give her some mustard seeds. But when Kisa Gotami asked if she had ever lost a family member to death, the young women said her grandmother died a few months ago.Answer: At the instruction of Buddha, Kisa Gotami goes from house to house in search of a single mustard seed from any house where nobody has ever died. She is filled with hope that once she finds it her beloved son will be restored to life by Buddha. But it is impossible to find such a house.When Kisa Gotamis son died, she went from house to house, asking for medicine that would cure her child.">
