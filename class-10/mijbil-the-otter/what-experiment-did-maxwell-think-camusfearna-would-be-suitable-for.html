Only ten minutes were left for the flight to take off and the distance of airport was about five miles. When he did this, he must have felt pity for the way the otter was hurt as well as worried at the same time.When the authors pet died, he thought of keeping an otter instead of a dog. This was his experiment. He also thought that Camusfearna would be suitable for keeping an otter as it loves the presence of water around it.">
