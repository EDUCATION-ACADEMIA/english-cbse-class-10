<title>How was the air hostess of the chapter, Mijbil the Otter?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Ans. The air hostess was very friendly and cooperative. Maxwell took her into his confidence and gave her a parcel of fish for Mijbil. He admired her and called her the queen of her kind.This was all probably because he had suddenly been introduced into a new environment and was hence a little cautious. On the second day, the otter changed a lot. He felt at home in the authors bedroom. From the second day onwards, he started sleeping on the authors bed.Maxwell calls the air hostess the very queen of her kind because she was very sympathetic after listening to Maxwells story. She understood how he might be feeling and then gave him permission to take the otter out of the box to keep on his knees.Maxwell and the otter Mijbil shared a lovely relationship. Maxwell treated Mij like his own son. He took very good care of him. He gave him many toys including marbles, rubber bands, rubber fruits and a terrapin shell to play with.What virtues do we find in the airhostess? Answer: The airhostess was somewhat friendly, and she allowed the narrator to place the otter on his lap. She could relate and empathise with the situation faced by the narrator. This shows that apart from being professional, she was a caring lady.">
