He suggested to her that Tricki must be hospitalised for a fortnight.He became listless and seemed to have no energy and fell ill.

He kept an eye on him for two days and gave him no food but plenty of water.Herriot asked Mrs. Pumphrey to admit Tricki in a hospital because instead of cutting down upon his food and making him exercise, she was pampering him.Answer: Mrs Pumphrey thought that the dogs recovery was a triumph of surgery because in two weeks, Tricki had recovered completely and had been transformed into a hard-muscled animal.They initially started by feeding him just water for two days, it helped Tricki imbibe a little strength and interest in his surroundings. He started to gain back his energy and showed interest in playing with other dogs at the surgery.">
