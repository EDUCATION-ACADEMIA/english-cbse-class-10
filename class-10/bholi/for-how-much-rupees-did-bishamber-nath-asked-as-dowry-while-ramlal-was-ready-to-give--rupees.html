He also threatened to walk away from the ceremony. Ramlal was afraid of the humiliation and so, with tears in his eyes, he handed the dowry money to Bishamber.Solution : Bishamber clearly declared that if he married Bholi, her father would give him 5000 rupees.He agreed to marry Bholi without any dowry. When Bishamber saw the pock-marks on Bholis face, he demanded five thousand rupees from Ramlal. Bholis father begged him not to demand dowry placing his turban at his feet.Even then he demanded 5000 rupees as dowry. Bholi stopped the marriage by throwing away the garland in the fire. She threw away the veil and asked her father to take back the money and refused to marry Bishamber.He demanded a sum of five thousand rupees. Ramlal begged for mercy and even placed his turban in Bishambers feet but Bishamber Nath did not agree. Ramlal had to give the money in order to save both his familys honour and his daughters marriage. Bholi could not bear all this and refused to marry a greedy old man.">
