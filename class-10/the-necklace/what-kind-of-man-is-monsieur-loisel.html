He readily parted with the four hundred francs that he had saved to buy a gun, so that Mme Loisel would be able to wear a nice dress to the Ministers ball. This shows that his wifes happiness was more important to him.Expert-Verified Answer Loisel was a simple man who loved his wife very much through the way he led his life and his attitude towards his wife, for going beyond his means to make her look ravishingly beautiful and take her to the party.Madame Mathilde Loisel, is a round and dynamic character. As a young, married woman, Madame Loisel is pretty and charming, but her vanity makes her feel entitled to more than what she has. In fact, because of her looks, she believes Fate has made a mistake, that she was destined for more.">
