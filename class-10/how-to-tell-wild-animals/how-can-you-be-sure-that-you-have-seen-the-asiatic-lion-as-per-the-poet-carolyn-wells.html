<title>How can you be sure that you have seen the Asiatic Lion, as per the poet, Carolyn Wells?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="She says that if you are visiting the jungles of the east and there you see an animal which has tawny skin and he roars so loudly that you will die out of fear. This means that you have seen an Asian lion.The Asian Lion is large in stature. It is brownish-yellow in colour. It roars very loudly. The sound of its roar is so terrible to hear that it can make one almost die due to fear.For identifying a lion, the poet suggests to look for an animal which is large and tawny i.e. orange-brown colour, whereas in the case of a tiger, we need to look for an animal with black stripes on a yellow coat.Answer: A person can identify the Bengal Tiger when a beast with black stripes on yellow body meets and eats him. This is how he can make out that it is the Bengal Tiger. 2.Answer: The poet talks about wild animals in a funny manner. All the dangerous, wild animals like lions, tigers, leopards, bears, hyenas, crocodile, chameleon have been portrayed humorously. The poet describes their dangerous activities in such a manner that they produce laughter.">
